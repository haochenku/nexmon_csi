# Channel State Information for Raspberry Pi

This project allows you to extract Channel State Information (CSI) of OFDM-modulated
Wi-Fi frames (802.11a/(g)/n/ac) on a per frame basis with up to 80 MHz bandwidth on
several Broadcomm Wi-Fi chips. For a full list, see the [original Nexmon_CSI repository](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon_csi).

**This fork and branch are for Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4 variants.**

## Usage
After following the [getting started](#getting-started) guide, you can begin extracting CSI by doing the following.
1. Use _makecsiparams_ to generate a base64 encoded parameter string which is used to configure the extractor.
   This example collects CSI on **channel 157** with **bandwidth 80 MHz** on first core of the WiFi chip, for the first spatial stream.
   Raspberry Pi has only one core, and a single antenna, so the last two options don't need changing.
    ```
    mcp -c 157/80 -C 1 -N 1
    m+IBEQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
    ```
    _makecsiparams_ supports several other features like filtering data by Mac IDs or by first byte. Run `mcp -h` to see all available options.
2. `ifconfig wlan0 up`
3. `nexutil -Iwlan0 -s500 -b -l34 -vm+IBEQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==`
4. `iw dev wlan0 interface add mon0 type monitor`
5. `ip link set mon0 up`

Collect CSI by listening on socket 5500 for UDP packets. One way to do this is using tcpdump:
`tcpdump -i wlan0 dst port 5500`. You can store 1000 CSI samples in a pcap file like this:
`tcpdump -i wlan0 dst port 5500 -vv -w output.pcap -c 1000`.

## Analyzing the CSI

The pcap file can be opened in Wireshark or parsed with a script. 
There is an example Matlab script in the utils folder, and a Python script is on the way.
Each UDP packet has 10.10.10.10 as source address, and 255.255.255.255 as destination address on port 5500.
CSI data is embedded inside the UDP packet's payload.

Here is the embedded data structure:

Bytes    | Type       | Name                    | Description
---------| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------
4        | `uint32`   | Magic Bytes             | 0x11111111
6        | `uint8[6]` | Source Mac              | Source Mac ID of the WiFi Frame
2        | `uint16`   | Sequence Number         | Sequence number of the WiFi Frame
2        | `uint16`   | Core and Spatial Stream | Lowest 3 bytes indicate the Core, and the next three bits indicate the Spatial Stream number. 
2        | `uint16`   | Chanspec                | Chanspec used during extraction. See `nexutil -k`.
2        | `uint16`   | Chip Version            | Chip Version
variable | `int16[]`  | CSI Data                | Each CSI sample is 4 bytes with interleaved Int16 Real and Int16 Imaginary. There are `bandwidth * 3.2` OFDM subcarriers per channel, and a CSI sample for every subcarrier is present.

# Getting Started
### Prepare Raspberry Pi
* Burn [Raspbian Buster Lite 2020-02-13](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2020-02-14/) onto an empty SD card. You can use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
* [Create an empty file called `ssh`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/), without any extension, on the boot partition of the SD card.
* [SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) into the Pi.
* With `sudo raspi-config`, set WiFi Country, Time Zone, and then Expand File System.
* Reboot when asked to.

**Note**: Ensure you're using the correct version of Raspbian. Versions other than 2020-02-13 will not work.

### Install dependencies
Install dependencies. Do **not** run _apt upgrade_, that will change the kernel.

* `sudo apt update`
* `sudo apt install git libgmp3-dev gawk qpdf bc bison flex libssl-dev make automake texinfo libtool-bin tcpdump tmux libncurses5-dev`
* `sudo reboot`

### Get Kernel Headers
As 4.19.97 is an older release, the headers available with apt are out of sync with the kernel.
So we get them using a script.

* `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RPi-Distro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source -O /usr/local/bin/rpi-source && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rpi-source && /usr/local/bin/rpi-source -q --tag-update`
* `rpi-source`
* `sudo reboot`

### Install Nexmon and Nexmon_CSI
* `sudo su`
* `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexmonster/nexmon_csi/pi-4.19.97/install.sh -O install.sh`
* `tmux new -c /home/pi -s nexmon 'bash install.sh | tee output.log'`

Your installation will happen in this tmux session. The right bottom corner will show the step running. Use `ctrl-b d` to detach, and `tmux attach-session -t nexmon` to re-attach.
